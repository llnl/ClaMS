"""

Compute the clustering quality metrics (ARI, AMI).
Noise points (cluster id is -1) are ignored in the evaluation.
Takes two data: cluster labels and ground truth labels.

Usage:
    python eval_clustering_quality.py -c cluster.txt -g gt.txt
    or
    python eval_clustering_quality.py -c cluster_dir -g gt_dir

Arguments:
    -c: path to the cluster file or directory containing cluster files (required)
    -g: path to the ground truth file or directory containing ground truth files (required)

There are two accepted file types:

1. Only cluster IDs:
Each line contains a cluster ID.
Point IDs are assumed to be 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, where N is the number of points.
This mode is not acceptable if there are multiple files in a directory.

2. Point IDs and cluster IDs:
Contains two columns:
the first column is for point IDs and the second column is for cluster IDs.

Both File types can also contain comment lines, which must start from #.
